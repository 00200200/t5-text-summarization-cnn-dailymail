## 🎯 Example Outputs

### XSum Example

**Input:** The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed. Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water...

**Reference:** Clean-up operations are continuing across the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway after flooding caused by Storm Frank.

**Model:** A flood warning has been put in place across the Scottish Borders due to flooding in Dumfries and Galloway.

### CNN/DailyMail Example

**Input:** LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him...

**Reference:** Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gets £20M fortune as he turns 18 Monday . Young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away . Radcliffe's earnings from first five Potter films have been held in trust fund .

**Model:** Daniel Radcliffe says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. At 18, he will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film "Hostel: Part II" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund.

## 🌐 Web Interface

The project includes a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio that allows you to:

- Choose between CNN/DailyMail and XSum models
- Input any text and get instant summaries
- Compare different model outputs

### Running the Interface

```bash
poetry run python -m src.app.app
```

This will start a local server at http://127.0.0.1:7861 where you can access the web interface.

### Features

- 📝 Text input with comfortable editing area
- 🔄 Model selection (CNN/DailyMail or XSum)
- 📊 Pre-loaded examples
- 🧹 Clear button for convenience
- 💫 Instant summarization

### Models

- **CNN/DailyMail**: Generates longer, more detailed summaries
- **XSum**: Creates short, one-sentence summaries
